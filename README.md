# MaxEd – The Ultimate NFS Mod Editor™ (Not Really, But Close Enough)

**Officially sanctioned by… well, me, Wixon.**

---

## 📝 Overview

MaxEd is a highly sophisticated, world-changing tool designed to revolutionize the way you *sort-of* tinker with NFS mods. Intended for programmers who “just want to help a friend” but ended up creating an actual editor.  

- Create.  
- Edit.  
- Pretend you know what you're doing.  

MaxEd doesn’t promise to fix your life, but it might make your modding life slightly less painful.

## ⚡ Features (aka things that actually work)

- Fully functional **UI Preview** — all buttons are clickable, some even do something.  
- Designed for maximal efficiency… unless you click too many things at once.

## 🤝 Credits

Big thanks to **X**, the modder extraordinaire, whose crazy ideas made me write kilometers of code. Without him, MaxEd would probably just be a fancy paperweight.

Feeling generous? Want to fuel my caffeine addiction and code-induced existential crises? 

Donation links are safe, easy, and won’t require you to climb Mount Everest.
