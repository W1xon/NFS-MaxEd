## 🧩 About

**MaxEd** is a *beta-stage* tool for editing and managing **Need for Speed mods** —  
built for modders, by a modder, and fueled by caffeine and genius design choices.

---

## ⚡ Features
> *(a.k.a. things that actually work)*

- 🖱️ **UI Preview:** all buttons are clickable — some even *do* something.  
- 🪄 **Dark mode:** because light themes are for pain.  

> ⚙️ *Currently in BETA PREVIEW — expect chaos, magic, and occasional “null reference” enlightenment.*

## 🧑‍💻 Credits

Big thanks to my friend — the **mad modder** whose wild ideas forced me to write kilometers of code.  
Without him, **MaxEd** would probably just be a `null` reference.
